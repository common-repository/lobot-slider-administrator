Creates a slide management interface in the WordPress backend and provides template tags for fetching the slides' information.

== Description ==

**This plugin is ideal for theme developers who need to provide their clients an easy-to-use interface for managing slider content.**

To fetch the slides, use the following code:
`//returns an array of arrays filled with each slide's info.
$the_slides = fourty_slider_get_slides();

/*
$the_slides = Array
(
    [0] => Array
        (
            [title] => Slide 1 Title
            [caption] => Here is the caption for Slide 1
            [link] => http://your-site.net/2010/09/14/hello-world/
            [image] => http://your-site.net/files/2011/01/steddyp4.jpg
            [external] => 
        )
 
    [1] => Array
        (
            [title] => Slide 2 Title
            [caption] => And here's the caption for Slide 2
            [link] => http://google.com
            [image] => http://your-site.net/files/2011/01/Slide3.gif

        )

	for($n=0; $n<count($the_slides); $n++){
	
		if($n==$slide_n){
			echo '<div class="indicator-on"></div>';

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I setup the slider animations? =

**There is no front-end slider component to this plugin**; it is simply the back-end interface for managing slide content. You'll need to implement your own jQuery slider. Find one [via Google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jQuery+slider).
